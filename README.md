## Get Strated

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed

### Workflow

1. **Fork this repository**

2. **Enable GitHub Actions** for your fork

3. **Find an available challenge** in GitHub Issues

4. **Check out the exercise branch**  
   ```bash
   git checkout qr_code_component
   ```

5. **Download the starter files** for the selected challenge and read the instructions carefully

6. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

7. **Edit files** inside the challenge directory (e.g., `challenges/qr_code_component`) and place any images inside its `images/` subdirectory

8. **Run the Prettier formatter:**
   ```bash
   npm run format
   ```

9. **Execute tests** and ensure they pass:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

10. **Compare screenshots** generated during testing (located in the `screenshots/` directory) with the expected design

11. **Create a pull request** to the matching branch of the upstream repository

12. **Ensure the pull request passes code review**

13. **Merge your exercise branch** into your main branch

14. **Update the main index file** (`challenges/index.html`) in the main branch to include a link to the latest challenge solution

15. **Repeat steps 3–14** for each new exercise

> **Tip:** You may also improve the UI of the main `index.html` file

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. **Set the gh-pages branch** as the Github Pages source in your repository settings

2. **Open your site:**
   ```
   https://USERNAME.github.io/ui_practice_challenges/
   ```

## Project Structure

Each challenge has its own directory inside the `challenges/` folder.

### Challenge Directory Contents

Every challenge directory contains:

- **An HTML file** - Main markup
- **A Tailwind CSS configuration file** (`tailwind.config.js`)
- **An input CSS file** - Similar to the Tailwind Playground setup

> **Note:** The `public/` directory is used for output only and can be ignored.
